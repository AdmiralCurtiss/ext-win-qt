This is the subset of Qt on which dolphin relies for development and
distribution tasks. The folder structure is maintained in order to facilitate
easier diffing against other versions of Qt.

Note that this subset only supports building of dolphin. If you want the Qt
development tools (like Qt Creator/Designer/etc), you will need to install them
separately.
